#Horiseon Matketing Solutions Challenge #1 Website

This project was to deisgned to provide more selectors/elements to the code rather than only being created out of Divs. 

There were also bugs found within the links up at the top that were not sending the user to the correct area that they were looking to gather information from.

The code was able to be modified to include all of the selectors and elements in the appropriate order that provides a user experience that is appealing to the common user.
